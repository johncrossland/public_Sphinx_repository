# public_Sphinx_repository

Public Sphinx repository to share ideas with the open source community.

Base .rst to convert to a GitHub Gist for information about using Markdown with Sphinx to output HTML via Recommonmark with Autostructify plus sphinx-markdown-tables and PDF via Pandoc to work around latexpdf not parsing the .tex output from Markdown for PDF output in Sphinx. 

Works around the use of tables in Markdown so they get formatted correctly in both HTML and PDF output allowing developers to contribute Markdown in GitHub for an automated documentation production system that outputs HTML and PDF via Sphinx in scheduled Jenkins builds.

Removed proprietary references to employer and product to share as a GitHub Gist with the open source community to share ideas and get updates and/or improvements as others try this out for themselves if they need to use Sphinx and want developers to commit Markdown.

Will also need to share in a Gist a related build.sh bash script that gets run by Jenkins to build the PDF and HTML output from Sphinx.
